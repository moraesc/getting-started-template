# Welcome to Codespaces: Getting Started with Python

This template is designed to help you get familiar with GitHub Codespaces and learn the basics of Python programming. Follow the instructions below to complete your first coding task!

## How to Use the Code Editor

1. **Navigate Files**: Use the file explorer on the left sidebar to find and open files.
2. **Open Files**: Click on `programming.py` to start coding.
3. **Run Code**: Click the "Run Code" button (▶️) at the top right or press F5 to execute your program.
4. **View Output**: The output of your program will appear in the terminal panel at the bottom.
5. **Edit Code**: Type directly in the editor to modify the code.
6. **Save Changes**: Press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac) to save your changes.

## Your First Task: Hello World Program

In this task, you'll create a simple Python program that prints a message to the console.

### Instructions:

1. Open the `programming.py` file (it should already be visible in your editor).
2. You'll see a single comment line: `# Write your code here`
3. Below that comment, add this line of code:
   ```python
   print("I'm learning how to program in Python!")
   ```
4. Run your code by clicking the Run button or pressing F5.
5. Verify that your message appears in the terminal output.

## Challenge: Add Another Line

Once you've completed the first task, try adding another line to your program:
```python
print("That's awesome!")
```

This will print two lines of output when you run your program.

## Next Steps

After completing these initial tasks, you can explore more Python programming concepts:

- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops (for/while)
- Functions
- Working with lists and dictionaries

Feel free to modify the `programming.py` file to practice these concepts!

## Getting Help

If you're stuck or need assistance:
- Click the "?" icon in the bottom left for VS Code documentation
- Use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and type "Help"
- Search online resources like Python documentation or tutorials

Happy coding!
